                <p>BGMI players need to improve game sense and strategies to win more Chicken Dinner. Here are the top 8 tips and tricks to better your in-game strategy and game sense.</p>

                    <h2>#1. Take secret positions</h2> 
                    <br>
                    <p>This tip is very helpful to pro snipers and long-range fighters. Don't try to take a camping spot that everyone knows, such as high-floor windows to snipe. Instead, you can shoot through hopper windows insides Erangel's School without being spotted.</p>

                    <h2>Training Grenading</h2> 
                    <br>
                    <p>There are three difficulty levels you can choose from. It is better that you start from difficulty number one. What you have to do here is that you need to throw the grenade at the target, and it should blow up right before it hits the ground or when it bounces up. If the target is under 20 meters, then cook the grenade until the timer reaches 1 or 2 seconds. Similarly, if your target is at 30 meters then you should cook the grenade until the timer reaches 2 or 3 seconds. </p>
